Trussardi [trusˈsardi] is an Italian fashion house, founded in 1911. It began as a leather glove manufacturer, and expanded its line to additional leather goods in the 1970s after Nicola Trussardi took over from his uncle. In the 1980s the company started production of ready-to-wear clothing, in addition to products including perfumes and jeans. By the 1990s Trussardi was selling internationally, with its largest markets in Italy and Japan. As of 2014 Tomaso Trussardi is CEO, Gaia Trussardi is Creative Director, and Maria Luisa Trussardi is President of the Trussardi Group.

Trussardi was founded in 1911 by Dante Trussardi, as a leather glove maker, selling to the public and to the Italian army during World War II until it surrendered to Allied Forces. After his death, Dante's nephew took over the business.

Nicola Trussardi's children and other family members are frequently used in the company's print and television advertising campaigns. This has included Gaia Trussardi, directed in a commercial for the perfume My Name by Gabriele Salvatores, and Tomaso Trussardi's Wim Wenders' directed commercial for the scent My Land. In 2014 photographer William Wegman produced a print campaign for Trussardi, featuring photographs of the company's trademark greyhounds adorned with Trussardi clothing and accessories.
